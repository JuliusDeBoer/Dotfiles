# dotfiles

## warning

Dont just blindly install these files.
My current install script doesnt back things up and will
overwrite all the files that are in this repo

## Installation

To install simply clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Semicolon255/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles
```

And after that cd into it and run the install script:

```bash
cd $HOME/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
