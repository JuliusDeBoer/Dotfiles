# dotfiles

## warning

Dont just blindly install these files.
My current script doesnt back things up and will
overwrite all the dotfiles that are existing in this repo.

## Installation

If you want to install my all of my files i would recommend
one of the following commands:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/JuliusDeBoer/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/JuliusDeBoer/dotfiles/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

(Yes i copied these from oh-my-zsh)

You can also just clone the repo yourself using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Semicolon255/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```
